# 🧪 SQL Lab

SQL Lab is a web-based SQL learning and database experimentation platform built with Streamlit.  
It allows users to securely interact with isolated MySQL containers through a browser-based SQL editor, while administrators can manage users, containers, and logs via an admin dashboard.  

The application is deployed on Streamlit Cloud and accessed via a web URL. No local installation or configuration is required for end users.

## ✨ Core Functionality

### 👤 User Features
- **User registration and authentication** via backend API
- **One isolated MySQL container per user**
- **Browser-based SQL editor** (ACE Editor)
- **Execute SQL queries** against a personal MySQL database
- **Automatic creation of a personal database**
- **Database schema explorer** (databases, tables, columns)
- **Query history tracking** (session-based)
- **Table previews** with configurable row limits
- **Protection** against destructive actions on system databases

### 🛡️ Admin Features
- **Secure admin login**
- **List users** (basic and detailed views)
- **Manage containers** (start, stop, restart, suspend, or delete user containers)
- **View container logs** per user
- **Centralized backend-controlled container lifecycle management**

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

### User Workflow
1. Access the SQL Lab application via the provided URL
2. Register a new account or log in
3. Start a personal MySQL container
4. Write and execute SQL queries in the browser
5. Explore schemas and preview tables

### Admin Workflow
1. Log in using admin credentials
2. View registered users
3. Manage user containers (start, stop, suspend, delete)
4. Inspect container logs when required

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Intended for **educational and lab environments only**
- Not designed for **production workloads**
- SQL execution is **unrestricted** within the user’s container
- Query history is stored in **session memory only**
- No built-in **rate limiting** or **brute-force protection**
- No automatic **container cleanup** beyond admin actions
- No built-in **database backups**
- Overall security depends on **hosting** and **backend configuration**

## 🔐 Data Security & Privacy (EU / GDPR Considerations)

This application is designed following **privacy-by-design** principles, but full **GDPR compliance** depends on deployment and operational practices.

### Personal Data Processed
- **Username**
- **Authentication credentials** (passwords are securely hashed, never stored in plaintext)
- **User container metadata**
- **Container logs** (accessible to administrators)
- **SQL queries** (processed transiently; not persistently stored by the frontend)

### Data Storage
- Authentication data is handled by a **backend service**
- **Passwords** are stored using **secure one-way hashing**
- **Database content** is isolated per user container
- No client-side persistent storage of **personal data**

### Data Minimization
- Only data necessary for **authentication** and functionality is processed
- No **analytics**, **profiling**, or **tracking**
- No **third-party data sharing**

### User Rights
Administrators can:
- **Delete users** and associated containers (**Right to Erasure**)
- **Suspend** or **restore access**
- **Remove all user-associated database data**

### Operator Responsibilities
The deploying organization is responsible for:
- Providing a **privacy notice**
- Handling **data subject requests**
- Ensuring **secure hosting** and **HTTPS**
- Defining **retention** and **deletion policies**
- Maintaining **access controls** and **audit practices**
